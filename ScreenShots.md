# Screen Shots #
Home screen.  This is the first screen you will see when you open the app.  Initially it will say "no data".  You will need to click the "Find Devices" button to get your bluetooth devices listed (as shown here).

Device from list selected.  This screen shows the result from a short press on a device in the list.  Here you can select to edit this device or delete this device from the list.  The OK button just returns you to the app main screen.

Image below shows how the location data is launched to a receiver.  The receiver can be several things.  Here it shows the options of Google Maps or the browser.  However, other things can read this data as well.  I use GPS Status  (on Android Market for free) for this.  GPS Status lets you look at a radar view where you can see the distance from your vehicle and the direction, and much more.
