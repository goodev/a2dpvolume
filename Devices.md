#A2DP Streaming Devices

# Introduction #

There are many ways to get A2DP streaming in your car.  Many late model cars (built since about 2007) have Bluetooth from the factory.  Some of the even newer models have A2DP streaming too.  Ford Sync is one example  This wiki page is a collection of links and info to some of the aftermarket devices.


## Motorola T605 ##
The Motorola T605 is a hands free cellular Bluetooth module with A2DP streaming as well.  You can find them as cheap as $45 on eBay new.  I have installed 4 of these and I really like them.  Here is a link to info about my installs: https://supportforums.motorola.com/message/234643#234643

## Motorola HF850/HF1000 ##
These devices are older and only support the hands free profile.  The HF1000 stores a local phone book and has voice dialing internal too it so it can be used with devices that don't support voice dialing.  The HF850 requires the phone to support the voice dialing and contact info (nearly all phones do).

## MonoPrice A2DP Receiver ##
This is a very simple Bluetooth A2DP stereo stream receiver.  They sell for around $20.

This device must be manually connected each time as it has no trigger to auto connect.  This is where A2DP Volume comes in.  I use it with Home Dock mode.  When my device connects to the Home Dock, A2DP Volume will automatically connect this stereo receiver.  Honeycomb and up will auto-connect at the point when Bluetooth is enabled.

## Accessory Power GOgroove SMARTmini ##
This device includes A2DP and Hands Free profile support.  It is an FM re-broadcaster so you can use it in any vehicle that has an FM radio.  Very simple to use and the sound is good compared to many other FM re-broadcasters. This unit lets you broadcast to any FM station so you can find a frequency that is clear.  It auto-connects to the last connected device on power-up.  I got this for $44 on [Newegg](http://www.newegg.com/).  No installation required.  Simply plug it into a cigarette lighter.  Great for use in rental cars.
