## GPS lock time issues ##
Many people have had GPS lock issues on many different devices.  Many Samsung devices would take over 45 minutes to get a lock.  I had the issue on my Droid 3 really bad.  It would often never get a lock even though I could see satellites.  Droid 1 would sometimes loose all GPS until I rebooted.

I found an app that dramatically helps the GPS time: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.canaryx.gpsaids
I went from often taking over a minute back to a few seconds using this app.  I also tried this app:

Between the 2 of them my GPS appears to be fixed now.

How do I know if my GPS is working?  Install this:

It is a great tool for GPS.

My Droid 1 would usually get a lock with accuracy down to 9m or better in less than 10s, assuming I was in a pretty open place.
